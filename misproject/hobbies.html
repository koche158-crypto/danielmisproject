                <h2>Theatre</h2>
                <p>In middle school, I really wanted to do theatre, but there wasn't a theatre program at my school. However, there was a theatre program at the rival middle school that my brother and I were able to get into. My brother and I would bus over for every practice after school, and we both made almost every play and musical. I continued doing theatre in high school and it really taught me the importance of repetition, and practicing certain dances until you got them right. I was someone that others could rely on to help with notes and dances. In my senior year I was one of three featured dancers in a dance-heavy musical, and when someone in a dance number quit before the show, I was able to learn their entire dance as well with the help of repetition and practice. I didn't get a lot of lead characters in theatre, but I became someone that the ensemble could rely on to help and support.</p>

                <h2>Skiing</h2>
                <p>All throughout high school I was in the cross country ski team, and I still love to ski to this day. My favorite part of skiing was going uphill because of how difficult it was. Knowing I could push through, climb the hill, and keep going was always a feat I am proud of when I accomplish. I also love trying to balance on one ski for as long as I can before I fall to either side. I got into skiing because both of my older brothers and dad are skiers. Once we were all skiing at a new location I had never skied at before, and my dad went a different path than the rest of us and accidentally came back over an hour after the rest of us had finished. Me and my brothers were really scared at the moment, but it all turned out well in the end. There is also a lot that goes into skiing with a lot to remember about posture, pacing, techniques in certain terrains, and not freezing or overheating. Despite the difficulties, skiing is my favorite winter sport and I'm glad I've stuck through it throughout the years.</p>

                <h2>Hiking</h2>
                <p>Hiking is a hobby I've mainly picked up in college to take a break and connect with nature, but I've gone hiking for years. Here in Duluth, I love hiking in Bagley and in Chester park. My eldest brother loves hiking as well and for years has taken me and my family to see various Minnesota state parks in the spring and summer. He is a plant and soil scientist and can point out lots of different plant species as we pass them. In boy scouts. I received my hiking merit badge and learned the importance of always knowing where you're going when hiking and what to do when you get lost. The main thing hiking has taught me is that taking a break and going outside can be exactly what I need sometimes.</p>
