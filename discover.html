            <h2>Choosing UMD</h2>
            <p>I chose to come to University of Minnesota Duluth because of how contained the campus is compared to University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I wanted to go to a U of M college, but I also didn’t want to have to take a bus to get to my classes. At UMD everything is within less than a 10 minute walking distance, and almost the entire campus can be accessed without going outside! I also wanted a college that was mostly my age range, and close enough to my hometown that I can take a bus there whenever I would like to. I like that UMD has a theatre department with multiple shows every year free to participate in. Of all the colleges I wanted to go to, University of Minnesota Duluth is the only one that fit all of my requirements.</p>

            <h2>Close to Nature</h2>
            <p>One reason I love Duluth is the nature and scenery. In my hometown I live next to a park reserve, so I wanted to make sure I still was close to somewhere I could go hiking and skiing. The first time I went to Enger Tower and saw the view, I was dumbfounded by how beautiful it was. It was right when all the leaves were changing color at sunset with some friends. I also love the iconic skyline of Duluth with the lift bridge as a centerpiece.</p>

            <h2>My Experience on Campus</h2>
            <p>My favorite study spot at UMD is in the Heikkila Chemistry and Advanced Materials Science (HCAMS) building. It has multiple levels you can study on with a great view of the surrounding greenery. I also spend a lot of time studying in the Kathryn A. Martin Library. As for different clubs I go to, I was a part of the UMD Rotaract club the entirety of my freshman year, and I go to KPB activities on campus when I can. I go to random events that look interesting as well. So far, I have enjoyed my experience at UMD, and I plan to continue here for the rest of my college days.</p>
